      <h1>McLuhan</h1>
      <p>Marshall McLuhan was a Canadian public intellectual working in communication and media theory. He became highly influential in the field because his work has practical application to both the advertising and television industries. His critical insight is that media shapes the way we think and the medium is more important than the message.</p>
      <p><em>Understanding Media</em> was published in 1964 and focuses on the way media is central to society and culture. McLuhan always started at the individual and defines media as a technological extension of the body.</p>
      <p>Later, with the invention of the internet and an increasingly connected society his works have gained a new perspective and again become influential. McLuhan’s work has been insightful in allowing a way to understand technology that he himself could not have imagined. Particularly technology in relation to older technologies, and technology in relation to ourselves, our bodies, and our way of thinking.</p>

      <h1>Cage</h1>
      <p>John Cage was an American avant-garde composer whose unorthodox ideas continue to have a profound influence on 20th century music. His 1943 percussion ensemble concert at the Museum of Modern Art marked the first step in his emergence as a leader of the American musical avant-garde.</p>
      <p>He experimented with indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, non-standard use of musical instruments, and musical use of non-standard instruments. He was well-versed in art and music theory, criticism, and dance. In addition to his work as a composer, he had been instrumental in the development of modern dance, through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham.</p>
      <p>Some of his most prolific works include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>4′33”</em> (1952), a piece in which the performers remain silent on stage for that time period</li>
        <li><em>Imaginary Landscape No. 4</em> (1951), performed by 12 casually tuned radios, 24 performers and conductor</li>
        <li><em>Sonatas and Interludes</em> (1946-48), performed witd a prepared piano</li>
        <li><em>Fontana Mix</em> (1958), a piece which is based on a series of programmed transparent cards that when overlaid, gave a graph for the random pick up of electronic sounds</li>
        <li><em>Cheap Imitation</em> (1969), an imprint of the music of Erik Satie</li>
        <li><em>Roaratorio</em> (1979), an electronic composition using thousands of words found in the novel Finnegans Wake written by James Joyce.</li>

      <h1>Rauschenberg</h1>
      <p>Robert Rauschenberg is an American artist who is best known for using non-traditional, non-art materials and questioning the distinction between art and everyday objects.</p>
      <p>Rauschenberg’s enthusiasm for popular culture and his rejection of the angst and seriousness of the Abstract Expressionists led him to search for a new way of painting. He believes that painting is related to both art and life and that the two cannot be separated. He creates art that moves between these realms in a constant dialogue with the viewers and the surrounding world, as well as with art history.</p>
      <p>His preference is to leave interpretation to the viewers, and allowed chance to determine the placement and combination of the different found images and objects in his artwork so that there were no predetermined arrangements or meanings embedded within the works.</p>
